# Apocalypse-RPG
I am completely re-doing this entire project from scratch

Originally this project was to refamiliarize myself with Python and get a better understanding of what classes are and how they work.

At this point, I am: 
- Trying to code this entire project with the principles of OOP in mind. I want this to be completely in objects if possible.
- I want to learn as many libraries of python as possible to add to my tools of python
- I want to be able to put this into a playable exe file my friends can play
- Maybe turn it into GUI down the road to learn GUI for python? Not sure

Thank you for reading this. I am open to any suggestions or thoughts on code/
